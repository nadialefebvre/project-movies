# Project Techniflix

Weekly project for Technigo's bootcamp, week 12: build a movie app

This weekâ€™s project was about creating a movie app using React Router.
We also were introduced to styled components. 

## The problem

This weeks assignment was in pairs, we started by structuring our work in order to make the most of our time. We made sure to have all functionalities working before adding styled components to our work. If we had more time we could have made a component to filter out the movies in categories.
